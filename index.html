        <h1>Toss a coin to your Witcher...</h1>
        <h4>Songwriters: Jenny Klein / Sonya Belousova</h4>
        <div class="verse">
            When a humble bard<br>
            Graced a ride along<br>
            With Geralt of Rivia<br>
            Along came this song
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            From when the White Wolf fought<br>
            A silver-tongued devil<br>
            His army of elves<br>
            At his hooves did they revel
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            They came after me<br>
            With masterful deceit<br>
            Broke down my lute<br>
            And they kicked in my teeth
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            While the devil's horns<br>
            Minced our tender meat<br>
            And so cried the Witcher<br>
            He can't be bleat
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            Toss a coin to your Witcher<br>
            Oh, Valley of Plenty<br>
            Oh, Valley of Plenty, oh<br>
            Toss a coin to your Witcher<br>
            Oh, Valley of Plenty
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            At the edge of the world<br>
            Fight the mighty horde<br>
            That bashes and breaks you<br>
            And brings you to mourn
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            From when the White Wolf fought<br>
            A silver-tongued devil<br>

            At his hooves did they revel
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            He thrust every elf<br>
            Far back on the shelf<br>
            High up on the mountain<br>
            From whence it came
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            He wiped out your pest<br>
            Got kicked in his chest<br>
            He's a friend of humanity<br>
            So give him the rest
        </div>
        <div class="verse">
            That's my epic tale<br>
            Our champion prevailed<br>
            Defeated the villain<br>
            Now pour him some ale
